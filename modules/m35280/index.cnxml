	<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="id13234822">Nanotechnology is an essentially modern
scientific field that is constantly evolving as commercial and
academic interest continues to increase and as new research is
presented to the scientific community. The fieldâ€™s simplest roots
can be traced, albeit arguably, to 1959 but its primary development
occurred in both the eighties and the early nineties. In addition
to specific scientific achievements such as the invention of the
STM, this early history is most importantly reflected in the
initial vision of molecular manufacturing as it is outlined in
three important works. Overall, an understanding of development and
the criticism of this vision is integral for comprehending the
realities and potential of nanotechnology today.</para>

<para id="eip-182">"But I am not afraid to consider the final question as to
whether, ultimately---in the great future---we can arrange the
atoms the way we want; the very atoms, all the way down!" -Richard
	Feynman, <cite><cite-title>There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom</cite-title></cite></para><para id="eip-168">The first time the idea of nanotechnology was
introduced was in 1959, when Richard Feynman (<link target-id="id10864007"/>), a physicist at Caltech,
gave a talk entitled <emphasis effect="italics">There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom</emphasis>. Though he
never explicitly mentioned "nanotechnology," Feynman suggested that it
will eventually be possible to precisely manipulate atoms and
molecules. Moreover, in an even more radical proposition, he thought
that, in principle, it was possible to create "nano-scale" machines,
through a cascade of billions of factories. According to the
physicist, these factories would be progressively smaller scaled
versions of machine hands and tools. He proposed that these tiny
"machine shops" would then eventually be able to create billions of
tinier factories. In these speculations, he also suggested that
there are various factors, which uniquely affect the nano-scale
level. Specifically, he suggested that as the scale got smaller and
smaller, gravity would become more negligible, while both van der
Waals attraction and surface tension would become very important. In
the end, Feynman's talk has been viewed as the first academic talk
that dealt with a main tenet of nanotechnology, the direct
manipulation of individual atoms (molecular manufacturing).</para><figure id="id10864007"><media id="id1166342487789" alt=""><image src="../../media/Graphic1.png" mime-type="image/png" width="250" print-width="2in"/></media>

      <para id="para3">Hence, long before STMs and atomic force
microscopes were invented Feynman proposed these revolutionary ideas
to his peers. As demonstrated in his quote (above), he chose to deal
with a "final question" that wasn't fully realized till the eighties
and nineties. Ultimately then, it was during these two decades, when
the term "nanotechnology" was coined and researchers, starting with
Eric Drexler, built up this field from the foundation that Feynman
constructed in 1959. However, some such as Chris Toumey minimize the
importance of Feynman in the establishment of the intellectual
groundwork for nanotechnology. Instead, using evidence from its
citation history, Toumey sees <emphasis effect="italics">There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom</emphasis> 
as a "founding myth" that served only to directly influence Drexler
rather than the other important scientists, who affected the future
development of nanotechnology. Nevertheless, though the ultimate
effect of Feynman's talk is debatable, it is certain that this work
directly influenced Drexler's own research, which thus indirectly
influenced nanotechnology as a whole.</para>

talk on atomic manipulation and "nano-factories." The Caltech
physicist's ideas inspired Drexler to put these concepts into motion
by expanding Feynman's vision of molecular manufacturing with
contemporary developments in understanding protein function. From this
moment, Drexler's primary goal was to build upon the physicist's
revolutionary foundation. As a result, though the term was yet to be
coined, the field of nanotechnology was created. </para><figure id="id15690652"><media id="id1166342722586" alt=""><image src="../../media/Graphic2.png" mime-type="image/png" width="250" print-width="2in"/></media>

	<para id="eip-945">In 1981, Drexler published his first article on
the subject in the prestigious scientific journal, <cite><cite-title>Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences</cite-title></cite>. Titled "Molecular
engineering: An approach to the development of general capabilities
for molecular manipulation," Drexler's publication essentially
expanded the idea of molecular manufacturing by integrating modern
scientific ideas with Feynman's concepts. Hence, he established his
own vision of molecular manufacturing in this paper. Specifically, in
his abstract, he discusses the possibility of molecular manufacturing
as a process of fabricating objects with specific atomic
specifications using designed protein molecules. He suggests that this
would inevitably lead to the design of molecular machinery that would
be able to position reactive groups with atomic precision. Thus,
Drexler states that molecular manufacturing and the construction of
"nano-machines" is a product of an analogous relationship "between
features of natural macromolecules and components of existing
machines." In addition, Drexler includes a table that outlines by
function the molecular equivalents to macroscopic technologies. For
example, he believed that bearings, which provide support for moving
parts, are analogous to Sigma bonds. Overall, generating some interest
in the scientific community, this publication presented Drexler's
initial vision of molecular manufacturing, which was ultimately
influenced by Feynman's talk.  As a result, the field of
nanotechnology continued to evolve, for Drexler took these concepts
and expanded their potential in an accessible format through his now
infamous book, <emphasis effect="italics">Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of
Nanotechnology</emphasis> (<link target-id="id7606165"/>).

    <section id="id5814566"><title>Eric Drexler: engines of creation</title><para id="id6916419">"Molecular Assemblers will bring a
revolution without parallel since the development of ribosomes, the
primitive assemblers in the cell. The resulting nanotechnology can
help life spread beyond Earth - a step without parallel since life
spread beyond the seas; it can let our minds renew and remake our
bodies - a step without any parallel at all." - Eric Drexler in <emphasis effect="italics">Engines of
Creation</emphasis>. </para>

      <para id="para6">In this book, Drexler is credited as being the
first person to use the word nanotechnology to describe engineering on
the billionth of a meter scale. Though the term was used by Norio
Taniguchi in 1974, Taniguchi's use of the word referred to
nanotechnology in a different context. Published in 1986,
<emphasis effect="italics">Engines of Creation</emphasis> served to present Drexler's vision of
molecular manufacturing that he outlined in his 1981 paper.
Essentially, Drexler presented, albeit simplistically, that if atoms
are viewed as small marbles, then molecules are a tight collection of
these marbles that "snap" together, depending on their chemical
properties. When snapped together in the right way, these molecules
could represent normal-scaled tools such as motors and gears. Drexler
suggested that these "atomic" tools and machines would operate just as
their larger counterparts do. The moving parts of the nano-machine
(e.g., <link target-id="id116634563711BB"/>) would be formed by many
atoms that are held together by their own atomic bonds. Ultimately, in
Engines of Creation, Drexler envisioned that these would then be used
as "assemblers" that could put together atoms into a desired shape.
Applying this simplistic vision of molecular manufacturing, Drexler,
in theory, presented that coal can be turned into diamond and computer
chips can be created from sand. These processes would occur by using
these fabricated atomic tools to reorganize the atoms that make up
these materials. Most importantly, from these principles, he
sensationally proclaimed in his book that nanotechnology, through the
molecular manufacturing of "universal assemblers," would revolutionize
everything from biological science to space travel (see quote
above). Thus, with both his 1981 publication and his 1986 book,
Drexler presented nanotechnology as a scientific field that solely
revolved around his own expanded vision of Feynman's molecular
manufacturing.</para>

<para id="eip-443">In addition, <emphasis effect="italics">Engines of Creation</emphasis> also cautions
about the possible dangers that accompany this kind of
technology. Primarily, Drexler warns of the "gray goo," an
amalgamation of self-replicating nanobots that would consume
everything in the universe in order to survive (see <link target-id="id1166345637110A"/>).</para>

<para id="id15732342">This book was highly influential as it brought
nanotechnology to the mainstream scientific community for the first
time. Though his theories of "gray goo" and molecular manufacturing
were later criticized, there is no question that Drexler's work had a
profound impact on the establishment of nanotechnology as a scientific
field.</para>

    <section id="id1166339222903">
      <title>The Aftermath of Engines of Creation: Impact and
Criticism</title>

<para id="id6893308">Directly after the publication of this book,
Drexler founded the Foresight Institute, whose stated goal is to
"ensure the beneficial implementation of nanotechnology." Drexler
used this "institute" as a way to present his vision of molecular
manufacturing that he vividly illustrated in Engines of
Creation. Thus, this "institute" was used to further propagate
research, through his influential yet highly controversial depiction
of nanotechnology and its future.</para>

<para id="eip-781">As a result, due to the publicity generated by
both Drexler's work and institute, scientists from all over the world
began to have a vested interest in the field of nanotechnology. Rice University chemist, Richard Smalley (<link target-id="id10638028"/>), for example, specifically said that he was
a "fan of Eric" and that <emphasis effect="italics">Engines of Creation</emphasis> influenced
him to pursue nanotechnology. Moreover, he even gave Drexler's book to
the top decision-makers at Rice University. Though criticizing Drexler
and his work in future years, Smalley, like other scientists, were
intrigued by this book and proceeded to do research in this new and
evolving field.</para><figure id="id10638028"><media id="id1166339222932" alt=""><image src="../../media/Graphic6-ad2b.png" mime-type="image/png" width="250" print-width="2in"/></media>

      <para id="id6163420">Drexler's vision of molecular manufacturing
and assemblers has become, on one hand, a scientific goal, through the
Foresight Institute, and, on the other, a controversial issue. Some
scientists have criticized Drexler's visions as impossible and
harmful. Richard Smalley has led this movement against Drexler's
almost sensationalist vision of molecular manufacturing. In their open
debate in 2003, Smalley writes almost scathingly, "you cannot make
precise chemistry occur as desired between two molecular objects with
simple mechanical motion along a few degrees of freedom in the
assembler-fixed frame of reference." Furthermore, he also
chastises Drexler for his "gray goo scenario" saying, "you and the
people around you have scared our children---while our future in the
real world will be challenging and there are real risks, there will be
no such monster as the self-replicating mechanical nanobot of your
dreams." In contrast to Drexler's radical vision, Smalley
realistically argued that nanotechnology could be used on a much more
practical and attainable level. As a result, due to the onset of
academic criticism from scientists such as Richard Smalley,
nanotechnology evolved from Drexler's vision of molecular
manufacturing to a broad field that encompassed both practical
manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities. Chemistry, materials
science, and molecular engineering were now all included in this
science.</para>

    </section>

    <section id="id1166342380517"><title>Important successes in nanotechnology</title><para id="id28634370">In addition to the criticism of Drexler's
vision of molecular manufacturing, three important developments that
were independent of Drexler's paper helped turn nanotechnology into
this broad field, today. First, the scanning tunneling microscope
(STM) was invented by Binnig and Rohrer in 1981 (<link target-id="id12593880"/>). With this technology, individual atoms could be clearly identified for
the first time. Despite its limitations (only conducting materials),
this breakthrough was essential for the development of the field of
nanotechnology because what had been previously concepts were now
within view and testable. Some of these limitations in microscopy were
eliminated through the 1986 invention of the atomic force microscope (AFM) (<link target-id="id13023999"/>). Using contact to create an image, this microscope could image
non-conducting materials such as organic molecules. This invention was
integral for the study of carbon Buckyball (<link target-id="id3034081"/>), discovered at Rice University. Ultimately, with these two achievements, nanotechnology could develop
through the scientific method rather than through the conceptual and
thus untestable visions of Drexler.</para>

      <para id="id10413507">This overall trend created by advancements in
microscopy is illustrated through Don Eigler's revolutionary
"stunt" at IBM. Here, he manipulated individual Xenon atoms on a
Nickel surface to form the letters "IBM" (<link target-id="id6309020"/>). With the microscopy technology that was invented in the early to mid
eighties, Eigler and his research team advanced the field of
nanotechnology by seeking to simply manipulate atoms. Thus, while
Drexler was conceiving sensationalized possibilities of "universal
assemblers," Eigler focused his nanotech research on the realistic and
attainable level that Smalley presented in his argument with
Drexler. From this "stunt," nanotech research followed Eigler's path
and therefore strayed away from Drexler's original vision.  Because
nanotechnology was viewed at this level, the field soon encompassed
both practical manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities as
Drexler's ideas were put aside.</para>

      <title>Conclusion</title> 

      <para id="id5982646">While nanotechnology came into existence
through Feynman's and then Drexler's vision of molecular
manufacturing, the field has evolved in the 21st century to largely
include research in chemistry and materials science as well as
molecular engineering. As evidenced by Smalley's debate, this
evolution is partly a response to the criticism of Drexler's views in
both <emphasis effect="italics">Engines of Creation</emphasis> and the Foresight
Institute. Thus, in regards to the development of nanotechnology in
the present, Drexler's vision can be viewed as an indirect influence
through the sheer interest and subsequent criticism that he created in
the field. As Toumey argues, Drexler and therefore Feynman did not
have a direct role in the three most important breakthroughs in
nanotechnology, the invention of the STM, the invention of the AFM,
and the first manipulation of atoms.  Instead, Drexler, through
Molecular Manufacturing and Engines of Creation, brought scientists
from all over the world to the brand new field. Consequently,
criticism for Drexler's vision was established by researchers such as
Dr. Smalley. Through this reevaluation and the parallel breakthroughs
in microscope technology, nanotechnology as a scientific field was
established in a way that diverged from Drexler's original vision of
molecular manufacturing. This divergence is illustrated through the
contrasting goals of the government's National Nanotechnology
Initiative and Drexler's Foresight
Institute. As a result, a thorough grasp of this early history is
integral to understanding the development and definition of both the
realities and potential of nanotechnology, today. Whereas Drexler
created interest in the field but also sensationally outlined a
nanotech revolution, researchers around the world have brought the
nanotechnology that Drexler first envisioned to a more realistic and
attainable level. All in all, today, the goal for nanotech research is
not to immediately create billions of assemblers that will
revolutionize our world but rather to explore the manufacturing and
non-manufacturing aspects of nanotechnology, through a combination of
chemistry, materials science, and molecular engineering.17Though
places such as Drexler's Foresight Institute remain, academic
institutions such as Rice University stay away from Drexler's
sensationalized vision of nanotechnology as molecular
manufacturing. This divergence is epitomized by the contrasting goals
of the U.S government's National Nanotechnology Initiative and the
Foresight Institute.</para>
